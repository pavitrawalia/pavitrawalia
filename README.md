I am Pavitra and I am a Software developer.

A punctual, dedicated, and a curious engineer who loves asking questions. A staunch believer that consistency is the key to success.

Actively involved in industrial internships and college societies while balancing studies.
Interested in Entrepreneurship and currently the President of Entrepreneurship Development Cell, MAIT.

My Technical skills include:
1. Android app development (using Java Kotlin as well as Flutter)

Gained relevant skills and industrial experience in both the fields through internships and mentorship experience.

Looking forward to venturing into the field of research soon.
